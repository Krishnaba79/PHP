<!-- 5.Write  difference between session and cookies. -->

Storage: Sessions store data on the server, while cookies store 
data on the client's browser.

Lifetime: Sessions have a limited lifetime and are destroyed when
 the user closes the browser or after a certain period of 
 inactivity, while cookies can have a longer lifetime and can 
 persist even after the browser is closed.


Security: Sessions are generally more secure than cookies 
because the data is stored on the server and not on the client's 
browser. Cookies can be accessed and modified by the client, which
 can pose a security risk.


Size: Sessions can store larger amounts of data than cookies 
because the data is stored on the server. Cookies have a size 
limit of 4KB.


Visibility: Sessions are not visible to the user, while cookies 
are visible to the user and can be viewed and deleted through the 
browser's settings.


Performance: Sessions can have a performance impact on the server
 because they require server resources to store and manage the 
 data. Cookies, on the other hand, have a minimal performance 
 impact because they are stored on the client's browser.
